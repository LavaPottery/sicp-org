*** 5.1.5 Instruction Summary

:custom_id: section-5.1.5
:end:

A controller instruction in our register-machine language has one of the following forms, where each <INPUT_I> is either '(reg <REGISTER-NAME>)' or '(const <CONSTANT-VALUE>)'.  These instructions were introduced in section [[#section-5.1.1][5.1.1]]:

#+begin_src scheme
(assign <REGISTER-NAME> (reg <REGISTER-NAME>))

(assign <REGISTER-NAME> (const <CONSTANT-VALUE>))

(assign <REGISTER-NAME> (op <OPERATION-NAME>) <INPUT_1> ... <INPUT_N>)

(perform (op <OPERATION-NAME>) <INPUT_1> ... <INPUT_N>)

(test (op <OPERATION-NAME>) <INPUT_1> ... <INPUT_N>)

(branch (label <LABEL-NAME>))

(goto (label <LABEL-NAME>))
#+end_src

The use of registers to hold labels was introduced in section [[#section-5.1.3][5.1.3]]:

#+begin_src scheme
(assign <REGISTER-NAME> (label <LABEL-NAME>))

(goto (reg <REGISTER-NAME>))
#+end_src

Instructions to use the stack were introduced in section [[#section-5.1.4][5.1.4]]:

#+begin_src scheme
(save <REGISTER-NAME>)

(restore <REGISTER-NAME>)
#+end_src

The only kind of <CONSTANT-VALUE> we have seen so far is a number, but later we will use strings, symbols, and lists.  For example, ~(const "abc")~ is the string ~"abc"~, ~(const abc)~ is the symbol ~abc~, ~(const (a b c))~ is the list ~(a b c)~, and ~(const ())~ is the empty list.
